Used javascript and the javascript library D3 to create the site and the visualizations. Used Affectiva Web SDK which is also using javascript. 

Generated own data from the values given by the Affectiva SDK. The SDK detects users face and spits out values for each emotion, those values were put into my data to generate the visualizations. Go to https://developer.affectiva.com/ to get access to Affectiva SDKs in various platforms.
